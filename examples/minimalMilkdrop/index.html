       * eel->Wasm compiler that I wrote, so we use `butterchurn@3.0.0-beta.3`.

       * This version is still using AMD modules, so it will write the export to
       * `window.butterchurn`. This is a pretty chunky files, so you way want to
       * find a way to lazy load it inside `importButterchurn` below.
       * Unfortunately, it's not an ES module, so I wasn't able to call
       * `import()` on it without some kind of bundler.

       * the new compiler. This module is also packaged as an AMD module, so
       * when imported without a bundler it will write the export to `window`. I
       * think the package was never that thoughtfully built, so the export name
       * is, confusingly `window.base`. If that's a problem, using a bundler
       * might help.
       *
       * As audio plays, Webamp will randomly cycle through these presets with a
       * cool transition effect. You can also press "l" while the Milkdrop
       * window is open to open Milkdrop's preset selection menu.
