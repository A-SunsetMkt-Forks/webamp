# Cross Original Resource Sharing (CORS)

One of the most common issues when using Webamp is related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

In short, your skins and audio tracks must either be served from the same domain as your HTML file, or they must be served with permissive CORS HTTP headers. This is a security feature of web browsers that prevents malicious sites from accessing resources on other domains without permission.

You can learn more about CORS in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).
